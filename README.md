Week 3 Homework

## Chris Duhaime 

# Summary of Homework

# For this assignment we were given starter code including an index.html, style.css, and a partially completed script.js file to complete and make the password generator fuctional.  The generateBtn was already defined and connected from the html with the getElementById.  generateBtn also aleady had an onclick to execute writePassword.

# function writePassword() is already declared but inside it is using generatePassword() that we have to create.  The first part of this function defines some variables and navigates through several screens to build into the chars variable that starts as an empty string.  Through the If else statements and for loop we determine weather the inputs are correct and which inputs to include in chars.  

# We can use the chars and length parameters as arguments within generateRandomPassword(chars, length) to help define the random selection followed after.
